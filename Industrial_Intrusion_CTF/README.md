# Overview

These are my notes from the challenges I was able to complete in the Industrial Intrusion CTF. I did this CTF completely solo, and was only able to work on it for the first day. This is NOT a writeup, just notes I took on how I was able to get the flags.

As a solo, I finished 701/5902.
